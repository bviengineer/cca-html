    <h2>I Stopped Running</h2>
    <p>I stopped running and thought to myself: "maybe if I walk briskly yet quietly, I can differenciate the sound of my running from the sound behind of me. 
        So, I did. I walked, briskly and quietly, and as I did, the sound behind be grew louder. 
        I panicked, my heart started to beat outside of my chest.</p>
