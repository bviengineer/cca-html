    <h2>I Attempted to Hide</h2>

    <p>It is an alley after all, a very long one. There must be somewhere I can hide. </p>
    
    <p>Let me check, locked, locked, locked. Just my luck, all these doors are locked. Oh, an open area, 
        let hide in here! Didn't see that coming. I landed in an empty, secluded, abandoned well. 
        Who will fidn me now? At least it will not be the person behind the mysterioius sound.</p>
